### Step 2: Backend Team Notifies Frontend Team

**Handoff Checklist:**
- [ ] All API endpoints deployed to staging
- [ ] API documentation reviewed and confirmed accurate
- [ ] Postman collection shared
- [ ] Test user credentials provided
- [ ] Sample data created in staging database
- [ ] Any deviations from spec documented

**Communication Template:**
```
Backend team to frontend team:

✅ Trip Rating API - Ready for Integration

Staging URL: https://staging-api.example.com
Postman Collection: [link]
Test Credentials: [credentials]

All 9 endpoints implemented:
✅ GET /api/trips/pending-ratings/
✅ POST /api/trip-ratings/
✅ GET /api/trips/{id}/ratings-summary/
✅ GET /api/admin/trip-ratings/
✅ GET /api/admin/trip-ratings/{id}/
✅ GET /api/admin/leader-performance/
✅ GET /api/admin/leader-performance/{id}/
✅ GET /api/admin/msi-dashboard-stats/

### Step 3: Frontend Team Implementation

**Tasks:**
1. Read `FRONTEND_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md` thoroughly
2. Test all API endpoints using Postman
3. Create data models
4. Implement repository layer
5. Build UI components (member experience first)
6. Build admin screens
7. Integrate with existing app
8. Test end-to-end flows

**Implementation Order:**
1. **Week 1:** Core models + repository
2. **Week 2:** Member experience (rating dialog)
3. **Week 3:** Admin overview screens
4. **Week 4:** Leader performance + dashboard
5. **Week 5:** Polish, testing, deployment

**Testing Strategy:**
- Unit tests for models
- Widget tests for UI components
- Integration tests for full flows
- Manual testing on staging

**Estimated Time:** 4-5 weeks
